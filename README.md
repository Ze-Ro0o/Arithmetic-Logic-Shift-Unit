# Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit

### Project Description

Structural Verilog Implementation for the ALU in Computer Architecture.
The ALU does the following operations:
* Adding two 4-bit numbers.
* Subtracting two 4-bit numbers.
* Adding 1 to a 4-bit number.
* Subtracting 1 from a 4-bit number.
* Bitwise ANDing two 4-bit numbers.
* Bitwise ORing two 4-bit numbers.
* Bitwise XORing two 4-bit numbers.
* Bitwise NOTing a 4-bit number.
* Arithmetic shifting right of a 4-bit number.
* no change.

Project is done for the Computer Architecture course in FCAI-CU as a team project.

### Concepts Used
